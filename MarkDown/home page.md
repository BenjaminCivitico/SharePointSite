#SharePoint 2016, Benjamin Civitico

This is a little site where I store information I've found useful for my work with SharePoint. I use this site myself as a sort of reference whenever I need to do something I have done before. The code found in the [snippets](.?p=2), and [tutorials](.?p=1) sections will feature minimal inline commenting. When I do code, inline comments are contextual.

The [snippets](.?p=2) section is for small pieces of code that I have had to use more than once and wanted to keep handy. The pieces of code here have references wherever possible.

The [tutorial](.?p=1) section stores longer entries with some more in-depth descriptions. There will be many code snippets in each entry. These code snippets are in a sequence of steps. I have included notes about pitfalls and mistakes I have made while using these entries in the past.

##About this Site

This site is created with a combination of HTML5, PHP, JS, and SASS. 

[Snippets](.?p=2) and [tutorials](.?p=1) are stored as MarkDown in a MySQL database. They are rendered into HTML using [ParseDown](http://parsedown.org/).

SASS is compiled into CSS using the [SASS Build System](https://github.com/jaumefontal/SASS-Build-SublimeText2) for Sublime Text 2 package.
