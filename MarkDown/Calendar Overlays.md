#Calendar Overlays

In SharePoint calendars can be created to allow teams to better communicate date related information, such as important events, team movements. While multiple calendars can be used to track different categories of details, but this becomes a little bit cluttered when calendars are going to be used as an app part on a team home page. In these cases teams have resorted to using the same calendar to track details in different categories and end up with an even more cluttered and hard to read calendar. 

To solve these issues and to allow fast and easy reading of team calendars Microsoft has a feature called Calendar Overlays that allow multiple categories of events to be displayed on the same calendar. This helps teams with recognition of milestones, and events important to themselves.

##The Cluttered Calendar

In the below example we can see that the infrustructure team, service desk team, and development team are all sharing a clanedar to track their team meetings and events. To add more confusion to this the same calendar is being used to track social events. It's easy to see that this calendar will very quickly become difficult to read, and so teams wont want to use it.
